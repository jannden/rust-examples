# Bitcoin Address Generator

This is an example project for my blog post [Bitcoin Address Generator in Rust](https://medium.com/@jannden/6326564474b7).

## How to use it

1. Use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to install the latest stable version of Rust.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the directory of this project with `cd bitcoin-address-generator`
4. Start it up with `cargo run`.

## Example output

```shell
Bitcoin Address: 18erjehTKFFpeqfVWBcAVo6ksRKjrUwgKD
```

You can verify the correctness of the generated address by checking its balance (zero), for example [here](https://btcscan.org/).
